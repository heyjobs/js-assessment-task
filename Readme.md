# HeyJobs Integrations Test Task

Hey Challenger,

Thanks for taking the time to complete this test task! The purpose of the task is to assess your skills, i.e. development style, code organization, project structure. We tried to make it fun, interesting and a bit challenging, and we hope you will enjoy completing it as much as we did preparing it!

# Background

We have an urgent need as humanity to collect and save all the chuck-norris jokes we can find. It's determined by US Government that chuck-norris jokes are the highest level of knowledge ever achieved by humankind.

Therefore they need to be preserved for efforts to re-develop humanity after a catastrophic failure, like not wearing masks in a pandemic!
We don't have much time left, head to https://api.chucknorris.io/ and start saving the jokes (also, maybe, humanity)!

# Challenge

Create a simple nodejs project that:

- Fetches 100 jokes from the https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random. (Don't use any other endpoint!)
- Appends the joke into a CSV file.
- Skips the joke if it already exists in the CSV file.
- Upload the resulting CSV to a service of your choice (S3, dropbox, gdrive, ftp)

# Extras

This steps are not necessary but can give you extra points:

- Use any modern bundling tool.
- Use es6.
- Write tests for your code (jest is a good option)

# Timeframe

We expect this task to take no more than 3 hours, we don't have much time anyways as humanity is depending on you!

# Submission

To submit your solution, please send us a public GitHub repo where you solution is contained. Please explain how your application should be used in a simple Readme.md file.
